msgid "The most common problem is a jQuery conflict. In short, if your theme loads jQuery library, then other plugin/s (like this one) also load jQuery then it can cause serious grief on the site and things start breaking. The solution is for all plugin developers and WordPress theme creators to use the copy of jQuery which is included in the WordPress core or load it from Google AJAX libraries, and to consider also using the noConflict jQuery mode (this plugin does all that). If you're having jQuery conflict problems on your site then the most likely culprit it your theme. <a href=\"http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/\">Read this article</a> by Chris Coyier which explains the issue in more detail and outlines how you can fix it. You might also like to check out suggestions from <a href=\"http://www.ericmmartin.com/5-tips-for-using-jquery-with-wordpress/\">Eric Martin</a> on the topic."
